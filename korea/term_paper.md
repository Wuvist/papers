To gain a better understanding of public sector economics, each student will write a short paper on the public sector of an economy, preferably in Asia, but NOT on Greece, Singapore, or the United States. The paper should not exceed 15 pages and is due by the time of the final examination.

The goal of the paper is to show an ability to apply the topics covered in the course to a real-world economy, rather than simply provide descriptive information or a recounting of events.

The project paper should provide a brief review of the structure of the government sector, including any important fiscal rules:
* ten years of key economic data for the country’s public sector
	* including data for the entire government sector and
	* if available, data for the central government
	* an assessment of the country’s fiscal (public debt) sustainability
	* and a discussion of two topical fiscal issues
	* preferably one each on revenue and expenditure policy (which could include transfers to and underlying problems with state enterprises) in the country.
* If relevant, the paper should address any issues regarding fiscal decentralization. While the paper may include comments by others on difficulties in the country’s public sector, students are encouraged to offer their own observations on the issue and how it might be resolved.

Students are encouraged to submit an outline of their paper by the eighth week of class. This will enable them to receive feedback on whether their plans for the paper match the requirements for the assignment and, if not, how the structure of the paper can be revised to meet the goals for the project. The outline should be no longer than one page. However, it should identify the main sections of the paper and the topics to be covered.
