The country has a strong tradition of fiscal conservatism, which has helped to keep its debt levels low. Additionally, South Korea's economy has grown rapidly in recent decades, which has helped to boost government revenue and reduce the need for borrowing.

However, it is worth noting that South Korea's debt-to-GDP ratio has been rising in recent years. This is due in part to the country's aging population, which is putting a strain on government finances. Additionally, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused a sharp decline in economic activity, which has led to a decrease in government revenue.

As a result of these factors, South Korea's debt-to-GDP ratio is now at its highest level in over a decade. However, the government remains committed to fiscal discipline, and it is expected that the debt-to-GDP ratio will begin to decline in the coming years.

Here are some additional factors that have contributed to South Korea's low debt-to-GDP ratio:

- **Exports:** South Korea has a strong export-oriented economy, which has helped to generate foreign exchange earnings and reduce the need for government borrowing.
- **Foreign investment:** South Korea has attracted a significant amount of foreign investment in recent decades, which has also helped to boost the country's economy and reduce its debt levels.
- **Fiscal discipline:** The South Korean government has a long history of fiscal discipline, which has helped to keep the country's debt levels low.

Despite its low debt-to-GDP ratio, South Korea faces some fiscal challenges in the coming years. These challenges include an aging population, a declining birth rate, and a slowing economy. The government will need to take steps to address these challenges in order to maintain its fiscal health.
