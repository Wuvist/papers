macroeconomic stabilization by the government (using fiscal policy) and the central bank (using monetary policy) can lead to a more efficient macroeconomic outcome than a laissez faire policy would.

Sticky prices, or price stickiness, refer to the resistance of a price (or set of prices) to change, despite changes in the broad economy that suggest a different price is optimal. This economic concept is central to many theories of macroeconomics and monetary policy. Several reasons account for sticky prices:

Menu Costs: This is the cost associated with changing prices. It includes costs like printing new menus, reprogramming computers, changing price tags, and informing customers. Because these costs can be significant, firms might choose to change prices infrequently.

Contractual Agreements: Long-term contracts for the supply of goods or services often specify fixed prices and prevent them from changing on a regular basis. This is particularly common in employment contracts, where nominal wages are typically sticky downwards.

Price Coordination: In some cases, one firm would be happy to lower its prices, but only if its competitors do too. This often happens when a price decrease could start a price war or if customers might view the lower price as a sign of lower quality.

Predicting Behavior: When prices change, consumers' behaviors change. Companies might hesitate to change prices because they are unsure how consumers will react.

Psychological Pricing: Customers may be used to certain prices and may react negatively to changes. Retailers often keep prices at ".99" levels because consumers perceive these prices to be significantly lower than they would if rounded up to the next dollar.

Macroeconomic Adjustment: Prices may be kept stable to avoid contributing to inflation or deflation. If businesses frequently raise and lower prices, it could lead to macroeconomic instability.

Government Regulation: In some sectors, regulatory bodies limit how often and by how much firms can change their prices. Utilities are a common example.

Cost-based Pricing: If the costs of inputs are sticky, then the prices of final goods will likely be sticky as well. For example, labor costs (wages) tend to be sticky, which can lead to stickiness in the prices of goods and services.

These factors lead to a situation where prices do not always adjust to equilibrate supply and demand in the short run. This is one of the key rationales behind the effectiveness of monetary policy and its impact on real variables like output and employment.
