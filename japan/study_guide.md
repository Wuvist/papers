# SMU Economics 6022 – Study Guide – Part 1

Following are questions that may help you prepare for your final examination and term paper.

1. What are the main elements of the Harrod – Domar and Solow – Swan models? What are the main predictions of each model, and how does empirical evidence compare with these predictions?

2. Can you do growth accounting, i.e., determine the quantitative contributions of key factors to a country’s economic growth if data are provided? What information would you need for this purpose?

3. What are the main objectives underlying endogenous growth models, and how do these models attempt to address concerns with the Harrod – Domar and Solow – Swan models?

4. What has research suggested about the relative importance of factor accumulation and productivity growth in determining country growth rates?

5. What does research suggest about the relationship between each of the following and growth: capital investment, finance, geography, natural resources, institutions (including democracy), debt levels, trade barriers, and parallel exchange markets? What might boost growth and what might inhibit it?

6. What “formulas” have some economists offered as a way for economies to grow? Can you explain the “new structuralist” approach to growth, how it differs from other approaches, and the evidence for and against it? What does Studwell’s analysis suggest about the growth experience of some Asian countries? What are the pros and cons of Studwell’s analysis?  

7. What is the middle-income trap? What evidence do economists cite supporting this hypothesis? Which countries might be affected?

8. What is “growth diagnostics”? Can you provide country examples of how growth diagnostics might be used to assess an economy’s growth experience and propose changes in policies?

10. What can one learn from the experience of countries with good growth records about factors that seem important for creating and sustaining economic growth? What has the Spence Commission found? What about the experience of growth in advanced economies?

11. What can one learn from Singapore’s approach to and experience with economic growth? What parts of Singapore’s experience might or might not be applicable to other countries?

12. What has been the experience of foreign aid in promoting growth? What do various studies show?

13. Is there a relationship between growth and economic inequality? What do early hypotheses (e.g., Kuznets) and more recent research suggest? What are economic booms? How can they affect growth?

14. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using GDP or GDP per capita to assess growth? What other factors (financial and otherwise) have some analysts suggested to consider in assessing growth? How does considering natural capital figure in assessing growth and well-being?

15. What does research suggest about the relationship between material well-being and satisfaction or happiness? What is the Easterlin paradox, and what does recent research suggest about it?

16. What has been the trend for growth in advanced economies? What factors explain it, and what measures might address the problems?

1. What measures could you use to describe the poverty situation in a country, including the share of the population in poverty and the depth of poverty? Be prepared to provide a brief, intuitive verbal description as well as a mathematical formula for any measure you mention.

2. What are some of the best-known measures used to describe income or wealth inequality in a country? Be prepared to give a brief explanation of how any measures you mention are calculated.

3. What have been the broad trends in poverty and inequality worldwide, among countries at different income levels, and within individual countries over the last few decades? Are developments in any specific countries especially noteworthy? What factors can help explain these trends?

4. How might you compare poverty across countries? Are there any global standards that might help? Is it useful to have different measures in countries at different income levels? If so, what are these?

5. What are some factors that help determine how extensive poverty is in an economy?

6. What are some factors that might increase inequality in an economy? What factors might reduce it?

7. What can you say about the relationship between changes in poverty and changes in inequality in a country? Can you give examples of countries where they have moved (1) in the same direction and (2) in different directions? Can you explain why they might have moved in the same or in different directions?

7. How does economic growth affect poverty and inequality in a country? Do the results vary across countries at different income levels?

8. Does the degree of inequality in a country affect its rate of growth? Can you provide any examples or cite any studies to support your assertion? Have views on this issue changed over time?

9. What sorts of measures can countries use to reduce poverty? Be prepared to give several examples, including measures changing incomes and measures involving non-cash benefits. Are there risks or  drawbacks to any of these measures?

10. What sorts of measures can countries use to reduce economic inequality? Be prepared to give some examples, including measures affecting income, taxes, and non-cash benefits. Are there risks or  drawbacks to any of these measures?
