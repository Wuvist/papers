_Capital’s Share of Output (a)_. National accounts data in Japan suggest that capital’s share of national income is about 35 percent. Estimates based on an aggregate production function approach, however, indicate an even higher share (of about 40 percent).[5](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9781557754622/ch02.xml#fn5) For analytical purposes, the work that follows will consider values of 0.35 and 0.40.

	When asked about why Japanese car dealerships did not sell American cars, he answered, "Why doesn't IBM sell Fujitsu computers?"[citation needed] When Japan's economy did not seem to be recovering from its 1991 collapse, Hashimoto ordered a commission of experts from the private sector to look into improving the Japanese market for foreign competition, and eventually opening it completely.
	Hashimoto's government raised the Japanese consumption tax in 1997. Although the government implemented a reduction in the personal income tax prior to raising the consumption tax, the hike still had a negative effect on consumer demand in Japan.[12]

	因腦溢血
	Obuchi was focused on two major issues: signing a peace treaty with Russia and reviving the Japanese economy of the Lost Decade. His solution to the latter was to increase public spending and lowering income taxes, which briefly slowed the recession but ultimately did very little to turn it around. One of his government actions was to give shopping coupons to 35 million citizens in the hope it would spark a consumer boom
	Obuchi's fiscal policy focused on strengthening the core capital requirements for financial institutions while issuing more Japanese government bonds to finance public infrastructure, which boosted the rising Japanese public debt.[6]

	而導致民調跌至低點的最主要原因，是福田內閣擬於五月十二日召開眾院院會，利用執政聯盟占絕對優勢的眾議院再次表決的方式，通過將備受詬病的汽油暫定稅延長十年的議案，使得民怨四起，更讓在參議院佔多數的民主黨表態考慮向參議院提出首相責任追究案來全面對決，朝野這項對決的動向備受矚目。


Tarō Asō 麻生 太郎: 24 Sep 2008 – 16 Sep 2009
	2008年，與小泉純一郎政見相悖的麻生太郎以絕對優勢當選第23代自民黨總裁和第92代內閣總理大臣之後，小泉純一郎宣佈退出政壇。
	麻生太郎與安倍晉三的政治理念相近，兩人共同倡議與和日本同樣意識形態的國家合作的價值觀外交政策方針，提出「自由與繁榮之弧」的構想。

	日本政府在2009年10月23日公開首相鳩山由紀夫及17名閣員的財產：鳩山的財產高達14億多日圓。但閣員中有人財產低於1000萬日圓，落差大，因此被說成是貧富懸殊內閣。

	Hatoyama's popularity soon began to falter after the DPJ struggled to meet the high expectations they set in the midst of a sliding economy. In May 2010 he faced a possible no confidence vote, and on 2 June 2010, Hatoyama announced that he would be resigning as Prime Minister.

	野田始终追求消费税增税来摆脱日本的财政困境，此议激起党内反弹，小泽一郎等坚决反对，迫使野田打算与在野自公两党合作来通过增税法案。尽管野田最终强硬通过法案，但小泽等人遂于12年7月初宣布退党，民主党陷入分裂。加上在野党的连番炮轰，最終迫使野田在11月14日的众议院会议上突然宣布解散國會，於2012年底舉行眾議院大選。民主党隨即因执政的劣迹在选举中大挫，在該次選舉的席次大幅滑落至57席，为创党以来最低，3年3个月的执政生涯也画上句号，首相野田开票当晚即辞去党代表一职。
	野田對日元升值過快、匯率頻繁波動表示擔憂，擔任財政大臣期間曾出手干預匯市。他亦認為靠節省開支根本無法解決日本財困問題。建議到2015年將5%消費稅率翻倍，減少債務。東日本大地震後曾臨時增稅以保證災後重建的財源，但由於民意反彈，後來不得不就增稅問題謹慎發言。

	In 2019, it was reported that 40% of key economic statistics collected from 2005 to 2017 contained errors, casting doubt on the effectiveness of Abe's economic program and the reliability of Japanese economic statistics. It was discovered that the labor ministry did not follow protocol by only surveying about one-third of all the large Japanese businesses it was supposed to survey. The data was eventually corrected, and it was discovered that the faulty data presented Japanese economic statistics more favorably than the corrected data.[78] The faulty data costed 19.7 million people about 53.7 billion yen in unpaid benefits, and costed the Japanese government 650 million yen to correct the error.[78]

Japan has experienced a number of major economic events since 1998, including:

- **The Lost Decade:** The 1990s were a period of economic stagnation in Japan, known as the "Lost Decade." The economy grew at an average rate of just 1% per year, and the unemployment rate rose to 5%.
- **The Asian Financial Crisis:** In 1997, the Asian Financial Crisis hit Japan hard. The value of the Japanese yen fell sharply, and the stock market crashed. The economy shrank by 2% in 1998.
- **The Great Recession:** The Great Recession of 2008-2009 also had a significant impact on the Japanese economy. The economy shrank by 5.5% in 2009, and the unemployment rate rose to 5.3%.
- **The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami:** In 2011, a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Japan's northeastern coast. The disaster caused widespread damage and economic disruption. The economy shrank by 1.2% in 2011.
- **The Fukushima nuclear disaster:** The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami also led to a nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The disaster forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people and caused widespread economic damage.

Despite these challenges, the Japanese economy has shown signs of recovery in recent years. The economy grew by 2.2% in 2018, and the unemployment rate fell to 2.4%. However, the economy remains vulnerable to a number of risks, including the aging population, the rising cost of healthcare, and the slowdown in global economic growth.

Here are some of the factors that have contributed to the economic recovery in Japan:

- **Abenomics:** In 2012, Shinzo Abe became prime minister and launched a program of economic reforms known as "Abenomics." Abenomics has three pillars: fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, and structural reforms.
- **Fiscal stimulus:** The government has increased spending on public works projects and other measures to stimulate the economy.
- **Monetary easing:** The Bank of Japan has kept interest rates at near-zero levels and has purchased large amounts of government bonds and other assets.
- **Structural reforms:** The government has implemented a number of reforms to make the economy more competitive, including deregulation, labor market reforms, and reforms to the education system.

While the economic recovery in Japan has been positive, there are still a number of challenges that the country faces. The aging population and the rising cost of healthcare are putting a strain on the government's finances. The slowdown in global economic growth is also a risk to the Japanese economy.

There have been several major economic events in Japan since 1998. Here are some of the most significant:

1. **Late 1990s: Continued Recovery from the "Lost Decade"**: Japan's economy had struggled with low growth and deflation throughout the 1990s after the burst of the asset price bubble in the early 1990s. The country was still grappling with these issues in the late 1990s.    
2. **2001: IT Bubble Burst**: The global burst of the IT bubble in the early 2000s had an impact on Japan as well. The country's electronics sector was hit hard, causing a brief recession.    
3. **2002: Non-Performing Loan (NPL) Crisis and Banking Reform**: Japan faced a banking crisis due to a huge amount of non-performing loans. This led to major banking reforms and a policy of zero interest rates to encourage lending.    
4. **2001-2006: Structural Reforms under Junichiro Koizumi**: Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi implemented a series of structural reforms, including efforts to reduce government debt, privatize the postal savings system, and deregulate various sectors of the economy.    
5. **2008: Global Financial Crisis**: The global financial crisis of 2008 hit Japan hard. Exports dropped drastically as global demand fell, leading to a deep recession.    
6. **2011: Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami**: The massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011 caused widespread devastation and triggered a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The disaster had significant short-term and long-term economic impacts.    
7. **2012-2020: "Abenomics"**: When Shinzo Abe returned to the prime minister's office in 2012, he introduced a suite of policies known as "Abenomics," which included aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus measures, and structural reforms aimed at revitalizing the Japanese economy.    
8. **2020-Present: COVID-19 Pandemic**: The global pandemic had a significant impact on Japan's economy, with decreased consumer spending and disruptions to the supply chain. However, Japan's strong manufacturing sector and exports, particularly to China, helped the country's economy to recover somewhat in 2021.
    

These events represent the major milestones in Japan's economy since 1998. It's also important to note that throughout this period, Japan has continued to deal with persistent issues such as a declining birthrate, an aging population, and a large public debt.

# Poverty

[Japan - Poverty - Humanitarian Data Exchange (humdata.org)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/world-bank-poverty-indicators-for-japan#)

The OECD reported in July 2006 that Japan suffers high rates of relative poverty. Another OECD report stated that Japan was second worst in poverty among the OECD member nations, in the mid 2000s.[1] The OECD, in April 2011, placed Japan at the 29th position out of 34 member nations, in the list of percentage of population living in poverty. With 15.7 percent of people in poverty, Japan was above the average percent of 11 among the OECD member states. Japan's 15.7% is above countries which have fewer resources and are less developed than Japan, namely, Slovak Republic (6.5%), Slovenia (7.2%), and Poland (10.1%) Poverty rate is increasing at an alarming rate of 1.3% in Japan, since 1985. The poverty rate increase average is 1.0% annually for all other OECD member nations.[3][7] The OECD report places Japan just below U.S., which has a 17.3% poverty measure, statistics indicate that U.S. has been cutting down on poverty, by a 0.7% decrease since 1985.[7]
