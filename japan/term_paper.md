To appreciate better the practical aspects of achieving economic growth and reducing poverty and inequality, each student will prepare a growth analysis for a specific country, preferably in Asia, but not Singapore or the United States, that:

(1) reviews the country’s growth performance for the past 25 years, discussing:
  * the source of growth data
  * the reason for choosing this data source;
(2) analyses the factors responsible for growth
  * using growth accounting;
(3) summarizes the country’s growth strategy, including:
  * changes in policies over time;
(4) identifies the country’s :
  * main obstacles to growth at the present
  * using growth diagnostics;
(5) briefly describes:
  * policies underway to promote growth; and
(6) suggests:
  * reforms and
  * policy measures that could further enhance growth.

The paper should also include information on and factors contributing to:
* poverty and
* inequality

in the country, with a brief discussion of :
* any measures underway
* under consideration to address these issues.

Students may refer to:
* the views of economists on the policies and performance regarding:
  * growth
  * poverty
  * inequality

in the country they are analysing when completing the paper.

However, they should use this information to arrive at their own conclusions about :
* The relative success of policies addressing growth, poverty, and inequality
* problems that may continue to hamper growth and maintain poverty and inequality
* and other measures that could promote growth and help reduce poverty and inequality in the country.

Where appropriate, students may also comment on :
* political economic issues that appear relevant in explaining growth performance, poverty, and inequality in the country they are analysing.

The paper should include a brief list of references used.
